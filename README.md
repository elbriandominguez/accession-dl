# accession-dl
This script uses NCBI's EDirect tools (`esearch` and `efetch`) to fetch nucleotide sequences based on accession numbers listed in a file called `accession_list.txt`. Designed for batch processing large datasets.

This was created because I needed specific datasets from a huge table of accession numbers used to create a phylogenetic tree. Instead of downloading the whole project, this allowed me to copy the accession numbers I was interested in for my needs.
